## What is it?
The Stanley Parable is a game that follows the journey of **Stanley**, an office clerk whose life is largely unknown. It is not known whether he is insane or not, this can be determined via the choices you make along the way. Explore a whole new world with just one turn, click or even just standing still. You will be accompanied by a disembodied voice who is only known as the **Narrator** but beware, he is not who he seems like. Stanley was a simple man, he was happy to sit in an office all day everyday pushing buttons. But one day, no one gave him orders to push said buttons. And so, Stanley went out of his office to investigate and finds that the whole building was utterly devoid of life. And so an adventure begins. Blow yourself up, explore the unfinished sections of the map, play a game in a game for 4 hours, play Minecraft and Portal through a game, find happiness, jump from the window, get confused with a yellow line or maybe escape your workplace. The possibilities are endless, what would you choose?

You will make a choice that does not matter, you will play as Stanley, you will play as yourself. You will follow a story that has no end, you will create your own story. You will have choices, you will have no choice. You will play a game that you cannot win. The end is near, the end is never the end.

This game is made and owned by Davey Wreden under the Galactic Cafe development name, using Valve's Source Engine. It was initially released for Steam in 2014; later in 2020, it was also brought to the Epic Games Store. There is also a sequel to this: **The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe.**

## Story
The game begins with a story of a man named Stanley who worked in a large company as Employee 427. His job is quite simple; Stanley only sat on his desk and push buttons instructed on his computer. This is what Employee 427 did for every day of every month of every year. And Stanley was happy...

And then one day, Stanley suddenly found out that every person in his office had disappeared. Stanley ventured through the office to find the answer, but what he found, is another matter. A terrible secret hidden deep down in the building, mysterious unexplored rooms in the office, and maybe wonders waiting to be discovered. Undaunted, Stanley braves the empty office, guided by the entity known as the Narrator (voiced by Kevan Brighting).
