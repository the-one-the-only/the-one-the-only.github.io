hroughout each of the five seasons, there have been different sets of rules each season. However, the main rules were generally similar: each player has a set number of lives, and after they lose all of them, they're out. Players are also limited to a small area to keep players in close proximity. These rules are generally the same, although there have been some changes; for example, in Season 4, lives were replaced by time, and when players ran out of time, they were out of the series. Players can also team up to create a complex web of teams and alliances that last until the final moments.
