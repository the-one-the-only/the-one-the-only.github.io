## What is it?
The Stanley Parable is a game that follows the journey of **Stanley**, an office clerk whose life is largely unknown. It is not known whether he is insane or not, this can be determined via the choices you make along the way. Explore a whole new world with just one turn, click or even just standing still. You will be accompanied by a disembodied voice who is only known as the **Narrator** but beware, he is not who he seems like. Stanley was a simple man, he was happy to sit in an office all day everyday pushing buttons. But one day, no one gave him orders to push said buttons. And so, Stanley went out of his office to investigate and finds that the whole building was utterly devoid of life. And so an adventure begins. Blow yourself up, explore the unfinished sections of the map, play a game in a game for 4 hours, play Minecraft and Portal through a game, find happiness, jump from the window, get confused with a yellow line or maybe escape your workplace. The possibilities are endless, what would you choose?

You will make a choice that does not matter, you will play as Stanley, you will play as yourself. You will follow a story that has no end, you will create your own story. You will have choices, you will have no choice. You will play a game that you cannot win. The end is near, the end is never the end.

This game is made and owned by Davey Wreden under the Galactic Cafe development name, using Valve's Source Engine. It was initially released for Steam in 2014; later in 2020, it was also brought to the Epic Games Store. There is also a sequel to this: **The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe.**

## Story
The game begins with a story of a man named Stanley who worked in a large company as Employee 427. His job is quite simple; Stanley only sat on his desk and push buttons instructed on his computer. This is what Employee 427 did for every day of every month of every year. And Stanley was happy...

And then one day, Stanley suddenly found out that every person in his office had disappeared. Stanley ventured through the office to find the answer, but what he found, is another matter. A terrible secret hidden deep down in the building, mysterious unexplored rooms in the office, and maybe wonders waiting to be discovered. Undaunted, Stanley braves the empty office, guided by the entity known as the Narrator (voiced by Kevan Brighting).

## Endings

### Left door endings
- Freedom Ending
  -Obey everything The Narrator tells you to do. Towards the end of the game, Stanley will destroy the "Mind Control Facility" pushing the "OFF" button, disabling the controls, then step out of the building into the green field. The Narrator talks about Stanley finally being free and able to do what he wants.

- Countdown Ending - Obey everything the Narrator tells you to do except for pressing "ON" instead of "OFF" on the Mind Control Facility's power. This will shock the Narrator and, instead of taking control of the facility, will initiate its nuclear self-destruct function, leaving the player to die while the Narrator enjoys their torment and explains everything.

- Museum Ending - Obey everything the Narrator tells you to do, but follow the Escape sign instead of going in the Mind Control Facility. You will end up in a long hallway. The narrator will continuously say that the end of the hallway will lead you to your death, trying to convince you to turn back. Reaching the end causes you to fall into a death trap that slowly brings you towards a large crushing machine. Just before you meet your death at the hands of the machine, a female Narrator takes over and frees you, giving you a chance to look inside a museum containing beta elements from earlier in the game's production, elements from other endings, and content that was cut from the game. After that, the female Narrator tells you that the only way to save Stanley is to quit the game, but staying put will have the metal jaws crush you to death successfully, leaving the screen black and restarting the game.

- Mariella Ending - Listen to the Narrator, but go down the stairs instead of up. Stanley will enter a never-ending paradoxical loop of rooms. As Stanley walks through the rooms without end, he begins to question everything, believing himself to be in a dream. He imagines himself to be a bird and to be flying through a star field in space, and then believes the Narrator is just a voice in his head, but then he realizes that he is not dreaming and ends up screaming for help, and dropping dead. In the end the Narrator tells a story about a woman named Mariella who just discovered a corpse of a crazy man while heading to work and that no one knew what was going on in his hellbent mind. At least, no one but Stanley.

- Escape Pod Ending - Listen to the Narrator until you reach the Boss's Office. Quickly enter and leave the Boss's Office, making sure the doors are closed. All doors behind you will be open (including the Executive Bathroom); go back towards Stanley's Office. door 428 will be open right in front of your office. (if you go back to your office and close the door, you cannot reopen the door again). Upon entering the door, you will be teleported to a long staircase. After you go far enough there will be a sign warning you that both the Narrator and Stanley need to be present in order for escape sequence to play out as intended. The Narrator was disabled earlier on, so the game restarts instead. If Stanley is holding the bucket during this ending, once the escape pod is reached, he will allow the bucket to escape. After restarting, the bucket is nowhere to be found. Restarting again will reveal a replacement bucket with a sign that says "REPLACEMENT BUCKET", and when picked up, will prompt the Narrator to say not to lose it again.

- Heaven Ending - First activate input on 419's computer, then restart the game. Go to 423's computer and activate input, then restart the game. This time, activate input on the computer seen just before entering the Boss's Office. Restart the game again and activate input on 434's computer. Restart the game once again and activate input on Stanley's computer. You will be taken to heaven. There are 432 buttons that move around and a choir that says "push the buttons".

- Broom Closet Ending - After exiting the meeting room and before entering the staircase, Stanley finds a door that leads to a Broom Closet. If he goes inside and stays in there, the narrator starts to get annoyed and eventually assume the player is dead and requests someone else to take their place. After Stanley exits the room, The Narrator welcomes player 2. If Stanley goes into the Broom Closet again, the narrator will get annoyed some more, suggesting they give the controls to something non-human, like a monkey.

If going into the Broom Closet enough times, after resetting the game, the Narrator will eventually board it up, preventing Stanley from going inside again. This is more of a gag than an actual ending.

- Bottom of the Mind Control Room Ending - Upon reaching the Mind Control Facility, perform the Monitor Room Glitch. Upon reaching the bottom, the Narrator will acknowledge the glitch's existence and remark that it is now an ending to the game, complete with a unique song that does not play anywhere else.

- Elevator Ending - Taking the Elevator that leads to the mind control facility up and down, the narrator will sarcastically comment on how he didn’t expect the boss’s office to be there, and how Stanley is a Narrative Master. After several time of going up and down the elevator, will lead to the narrator sending Stanley to a conference hall where he will give a press conference about himself.

### Right door endings

- Confusion Ending - Take the right door, go left in the open door, use the elevator inside the Maintenance Room. Taking this route leaves the Narrator confused as to which direction to go. After opening and closing two doors in Stanley's face, he opens a garage door that leads to the Monitor Room. In successive restarts, Stanley will always end up in the Monitor Room.

After two restarts (ending with multiple doors, then with no doors,) the Narrator decides to use a guide called The Stanley Parable Adventure Line™ or Line™ for short. However, the Adventure Line™ keeps leading back to the Monitor Room.

On the next restart, the Narrator and Stanley decide to venture away from the Line™, eventually coming to a room with the Confusion Ending Schedule, wherein the Narrator refuses to restart the game as per the schedule. He "breaks" the game, which eventually resets without his consent.

- Powerful Ending - Take the right door, go into the warehouse, and drop to your death without boarding the platform. The Narrator will applaud Stanley for jumping then the game will restart.

- Cold Feet Ending - Same as Powerful Ending, but quickly get off the lift before it takes you and then jump off to the floor below. The Narrator then speaks some sarcastic comments on this ending, mocking you for forcing yourself to fall to your death.

- Apartment Ending - Take the right door, go into the Warehouse, take the cargo lift across without jumping and answer the phone in the Phone Room. This teleports Stanley in front of what appears to be his apartment, but when he opens the door, expecting his wife, he finds a robotic mannequin. Attempting to leave instead of entering his apartment prompts the Narrator to block Stanley, forcing him to enter his apartment. As the screen tells the player to press a specific button, the apartment around Stanley begins to change into his office (in some cases the apartment will remain the same if you pressed other buttons than stated to push, however, there is still no way to progress through the story line meaning the player will still have to restart) while the Narrator tells Stanley the Story of The Death of a Man Named Stanley.

- Not Stanley Ending - Do what you would do for the Phone Ending, but instead of answering the phone, crouch next to the outlet and unplug the phone. The Narrator learns about the players role in controlling Stanley and shows Stanley a hilarious video about Choice. Then return to the Two Doors Room.

Taking the right door will prompt further "Narrative Contradiction," and when you enter the left door, the Meeting Room will have been destroyed and distorted. The Narrator shuts down the game and goes on a rant about how Stanley destroyed his work. He is cut off by a sudden restarting of the game, with Stanley reappearing in front of the two doors after returning from the cargo room.

Taking the left door will allow the game to proceed as normal (without the option to go downstairs, with the railing blocking the entrance to do so, and the ability to open the door to the Broom Closet). Instead of a keypad to access the Mind Control Facility, you are presented with a voice box in which you must speak the password. The player can't do so because Stanley is silent and the game does not include access to your microphone to speak, but the Narrator is unaware of this and launches on a tirade about entering the right door and "doing whatever the hell you wanted".

In the end after going through both doors at least once, you (the player, not Stanley) leave Stanley's body and appear above the ceiling in the two doors room, presumably removed from Stanley by the Narrator (after returning from the Warehouse). Not having anyone controlling him, Stanley is frozen in place. The Narrator then pleads for Stanley to do something as the credits roll.

- Zending - Take the right door, go into the warehouse, take the lift and jump onto the catwalk, take the red door. You will be transported to a Starry Dome where you and the Narrator can find "True Happiness". You can find a path to go inside another room and climbs a set of stairs which are cut off at the highest point. The Narrator notices what you are trying to do and begs you not to jump off the stairs. When you do, you survive the fall. Relieved, The Narrator hopefully suggests that you return to the Starry Dome room where you and the Narrator will be happy again. But if you continue to jump off the stairs several more times while the Narrator begs you not to do so, you will die, making the screen fade to black and the game restart.

- Games Ending - Disobey The Narrator to the end; take the right door, go into the warehouse, take the lift and jump onto the catwalk. Take the blue door 3 times. You will walk into a large room full of developer textures that the Narrator had not finished building yet. The Narrator will show some ways to improve the game that he had been working on, due to your apparent distaste for the Narrator's intended story. They include the original two doors room, this time with a third door to the far right, featuring a wooden door and orange hallway, starkly contrasting with the other two doors.

You are then taken to a "baby" game, preventing a baby from crawling left into fire. If you fail the game, you are taken to a Minecraft lookalike game. Since you cannot interact with blocks, you must watch the Narrator create a house. Once you get in, the Narrator will say that the house should be rebuilt out of diamond. As you walk further into the hole, the lighting dims and the Narrator laments on how open-ended the game is.

You are then taken to the first level of Portal. However, when you place the Weighted Storage Cube on the Heavy-Duty Super-Colliding Super Button, the Narrator activates the elevator before you are in, forcing you to fall through a hole into a remnant of the office building from the original Half-Life 2 mod. If you walk back after going to Stanley's office, the screen turns to black and the Narrator closes this ending with some thoughtful dialogue.

You can also break the puzzle by putting the Weighted Storage Cube through the door, surprising The Narrator. The Narrator won't let you out, and says that you should get cozy with the Heavy-Duty Super-Colliding Super Button.

- Art Ending - Do what you would do to get the Games Ending. However, when you get to the baby game, play it for 2 hours. A puppy will open, doubling the difficulty and forcing you to take care of both the baby and puppy. Play for another 2 hours, and the Essence of Divine Art will talk to you.

- Vent Ending - Climbing up the boxes near the entrance to the warehouse and dropping down onto a ledge allows Stanley to access a small vent which he can climb into. Entering leads to a secluded part of the Warehouse where the narrator begins to repeat his dialogue on loop, his voice being revealed to have been coming from a hidden tape recorder. However, the real narrator then reveals himself and chastises Stanley for falling for such a contrived twist.

### Pre-Two Doors Room endings

- Coward Ending - Close the door to your office at the start of the game. Instead of exploring The Office, Stanley chooses to sit there staring at the screen, hoping some commands will pop out. The Narrator will utter some comments about Stanley and his cowardice and the game resets.

- Out of Map Ending - Get on top on the desk on the left with the square computer (434) in the first office and leave through the window. This is possible by walking up to the chair and continuing on top of it. You will then crouch and leave through the window. Stanley will be given a choice. Select either "yes" or "no". If you select "yes", The Narrator will sing a song for Stanley. If you select "no" the Narrator will tell you about the possibilities if you answered "yes".

- Serious Ending - Type '-console' in the game launch options. Run the game, and input 'sv_cheats 1' in the console. This will teleport you to the 'Serious' room, where you are sentenced to stay for one hundred billion trillion years. If "sv_cheats 1" is input again, you will be again sent to the room, but this time, you are sentenced for "infinity years." If "sv_cheats 1" is input a third time, the Narrator will give up and abandon the player to begin searching for a more serious table. Inputting after this "sv_cheats 1" will have no further effect.

- Whiteboard Ending - Sometimes when the game starts/restarts the office is all blue-ish. When this occurs, you can open room 426. Once opened, you will a small room in which a whiteboard hangs on the wall, saying "Welcome to the... WHITEBOARD ENDING!!" This is more like an easter egg or a joke given by the game's developers. The Whiteboard also has 'Console >bark' written in the lower right corner, which is a console command that makes the USE button make a barking sound however, on ps4/5 it says dog mode with a check box and you have to interact with it.

- Infinite Hole Ending - While Stanley visits the Expo Hall during the Sequel Ending, he can come across an Infinite Hole made by the Narrator. Hopping inside and waiting it out reveals that the hole is in fact not infinite, much to the Narrator's frustration. Repeatedly jumping into the hole will cause it to become shorter and shorter, until it is so short that Stanley becomes trapped and cannot teleport back out. The Narrator gives up and abandons Stanley, at which point the hole begins to sink into the ground, implying that it was truly infinite after all. The player is able to press various buttons to change the visuals, such as the angle, the background, the music, and even Stanley's character model. After a while though, the Narrator will return to further mock Stanley, abruptly ending the sequence.
